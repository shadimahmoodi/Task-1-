U-shape Transformer for Underwater Image Enhancement( Lintao Peng, Chunli Zhu, and Liheng Bian ) 
https://github.com/LintaoPeng/U-shape_Transformer_for_Underwater_Image_Enhancement

This repository is the official PyTorch implementation of U-shape Transformer for Underwater Image Enhancement. It has been designed for Dr. Ali Reza Alaei & Dr. Vinh Bui 


The problems in under water images:

1- light absorption and scattering of underwater impurities lead to poor underwater imaging quality.

2-The existing data-driven based underwater image enhancement (UIE) techniques suffer from the lack of a large-scale dataset containing various underwater scenes and high-fidelity reference images.


-- The results of Traditional Method ( Fusion , RGHS ) and Deep Learning-BASED Methods ( FUnIE and UNGN ) and U-shape Transformer ( proposed method) has been compared.
